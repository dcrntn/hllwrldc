# Text to console 
A small practice program in C. Particullary to use dynamic mem allocation, recursion etc..
It's written to be twisted and doesn't come close to best practices.
Time complexity is probably Oh(no).
Do not take it too seriously!

## How does it work
1. Creates a linked list of ASCII characters from 'A' up to 'z' and 'space'
2. Reads the 'text.txt'
3. Organises the character position in the text.txt using the character position in the LL
4. Writes out the binary file 'text.bin' 
5. Reads the binary file int by int and recreates the text.txt character position
6. Spits everything out to the console

## Usage
If you for some reason want to try this out.
1. Clone this repo
2. Compile with some C compiler (e.g gcc)
3. Run the program
