This is a slightly more complicated Hello World program
It works with thi ASCII characters from A to z and space
Takes the text[dot]txt file as input creates text[dot]bin then outputs the text to the console
While doing it kinda in a complicated way
AFTER THE LAST TEXT A SPACE AND NEW LINE IS NEEDED
